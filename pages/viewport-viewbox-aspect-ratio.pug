            | A Look At SVG viewBox and viewport

    h2 viewport
    p.lead viewport is defined by&nbsp;
      strong width and height&nbsp;
      | SVG attributes
    p The viewport is the viewing area where the SVG will be visible. You can think of the viewport as a window through which you can see a particular scene. The scene may be entirely or partially visible through that window.

    p You specify the size of the viewport using the width and height attributes on the outermost svg element.

    h2 viewBox
    p.lead viewBox values are&nbsp;
      strong min-x, min-y, width, height

    p The viewBox always thrive to fit the viewport. If it is bigger than the viewport it will scale down. If it is smaller than the viewport it will scale up to fit the viewport.

    p Before the the scaling process of the viewBox to fit the viewport, it will crop the graphics inside its area. And when the process of scaling up or down occurs it will also affect the graphics contained bu the viewBox.

    .alert.alert-info When the viewBox have the same width and height as the viewport that wraps it, it will remain unchanged.

    h2 preserveAspectRatio
    p.lead It boils down to preserveAspectRatio = "&lt;align&gt; &lt;meetOrSlice&gt;"

    .alert.alert-info Left unspecified the default setting for preserveAspectRatio forces uniform scaling and the entire viewBox is visible within the viewport.

      .panel-body
        p You combine the x- and y-parts into a single value by appending the y-part after the x-part.
        p Examples &nbsp;
          strong xMaxYMax

            th Description
        tr
          td xMin
          td Align minimum x of view box with the left edge of the viewport.
        tr
          td xMid
          td Align midpoint on the x-axis of view box with the center of the viewport on the x-axis.
        tr
          td xMax
          td Align maximum x of view box with the right edge of the viewport.
        tr
          td YMin
          td Align minimum y of view box with the top edge of the viewport.
        tr
          td YMid
          td Align midpoint on the y-axis of view box with the center point of the viewport on the y-axis.
        tr
          td YMax
          td Align maximum y of view box with the bottom edge of the viewport.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading Second part of preserveAspectRatio attribute
      .panel-body
        p Examples &nbsp;
          strong preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
          |  or&nbsp;
          strong preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin slice"
      table.table.table-bordered.paths-table
        thead
          tr
            th Value
            th Description
        tr
          td meet
          td Preserves aspect ratio and scales view box to fit within viewport.
        tr
          td slice
          td Preserves aspect ratio and slices off any part of the image that does not fit inside the viewport.
        tr
          td none
          td Does not preserve aspect ratio. Scales image to fit view box fully into viewport. Proportions will be distorted.
